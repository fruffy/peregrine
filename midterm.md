1. [Definition/Explanation] In the context of the VL2 paper, what does the term "agility" mean?

### Reference Answer
Ans: Agility is the ability to freely assign any physical server machine in the
datacenter to any service, regardless of the location of the server machine. To
achieve this, we need to be able to maintain the same application address of a
service even if the service's VM is migrated to a different physical server
with a different locator address.

### GPT3
In the VL2 paper, "agility" refers to the ability of a network to quickly and efficiently adapt to changes in network conditions and requirements. It involves dynamically allocating network resources to meet the changing needs of virtual machines (VMs) and applications, enabling seamless network reconfiguration and accommodating VM migrations and fluctuations in traffic patterns. The goal is to achieve workload balance, fault tolerance, and optimal resource utilization through mechanisms such as dynamic addressing, load balancing, and a reconfigurable network fabric. Overall, agility in VL2 ensures the network can rapidly respond and adapt to evolving demands and configurations.

### GPT4
In the context of the VL2 paper, “agility” refers to the ability of the network to be responsive to change and engineered for all-to-all connectivity with no contention inside the network.

2. [Comparison/Analysis] Which of these 2 protocols consumes more router memory for its
implementation and why: weighted fair queueing (WFQ) or explicit control
protocol (XCP)?

### Reference Answer
Ans: WFQ because it maintains per-flow state on the router. XCP puts per-flow
state in packets.

### GPT 3
XCP (explicit control protocol) typically consumes more router memory for its implementation compared to WFQ (weighted fair queueing). This is because XCP involves maintaining explicit feedback information for each active flow, including congestion signals and feedback estimates. This explicit feedback mechanism requires storing additional state information for each flow, resulting in higher memory consumption. On the other hand, WFQ requires storing per-flow weights but generally consumes lower memory compared to XCP.

### GPT 4
I'm sorry, but I couldn't find any specific information comparing the router memory consumption of weighted fair queueing (WFQ) and explicit control protocol (XCP). Would you like me to search for more information on this topic or something else?

3. [Justification/Reasoning] Does it make sense for an ISP to route traffic originating from the ISP's
customers to one of the ISP's peer's customers? Does it make sense for an ISP
to route traffic originating from the ISP's provider to one of the ISP's peer's
customers? Say why or why not in each case.

### Reference Answer
Ans: Yes, because it makes money from its customers and pays nothing to its
peer. No, because it pays money to its provider and makes nothing off its peer.

### GPT 3
For better clarity, let's address each case separately:

1. Routing traffic from an ISP's customers to one of the ISP's peer's customers:
   - It generally does not make sense for an ISP to route traffic from its own customers to one of its peer's customers. 
   - ISPs typically prioritize delivering traffic within their own network and direct customer traffic to destinations outside their network through transit providers or peering connections. 
   - Routing traffic to a peer's customer would add unnecessary complexity and potentially increase costs for the ISP, as it would involve passing traffic through multiple networks instead of keeping it within their own network.

2. Routing traffic originating from an ISP's provider to one of the ISP's peer's customers:
   - In certain situations, it can make sense for an ISP to route traffic from its provider to one of its peer's customers, but it depends on the specific circumstances.
   - ISPs have complex routing policies and relationships, and they aim to deliver traffic in the most efficient and cost-effective manner.
   - If the peer's customer represents a more direct and efficient route for the traffic from the ISP's provider, and if there are appropriate peering agreements and connectivity in place, the ISP may choose to route the traffic through its peer to reach that customer.

Overall, routing decisions for ISPs depend on factors such as network topology, traffic optimization, cost considerations, and existing peering relationships. While routing traffic from an ISP's customers to a peer's customers is generally uncommon, routing traffic from an ISP's provider to a peer's customer can be considered in specific scenarios where it offers better efficiency and benefits based on established agreements and network configurations.

### GPT 4
Yes, it can make sense for an ISP to route traffic originating from the ISP's customers to one of the ISP's peer's customers. This is because ISPs often have peering agreements with other ISPs to exchange traffic between their respective customers. This allows for more efficient routing of traffic and can reduce the cost of transit for the ISPs involved.

As for routing traffic originating from the ISP's provider to one of the ISP's peer's customers, it would depend on the specific agreements and relationships between the ISPs involved. In general, an ISP would route traffic from its provider to its peer's customers if it has a transit agreement with its provider and a peering agreement with its peer. However, the specifics of these agreements and relationships can vary and would ultimately determine whether or not it makes sense for the ISP to route traffic in this way.

4. [Explanation/Clarification] Explain how you can implement multihoming using the border gateway protocol.

### Reference Answer
Ans: Advertise 2 paths to the same IP prefix with different AS paths. In one of
the AS paths, artifically add ASes to make the path look worse than the other
on the metric of AS path length.

### GPT 3
Implementing multihoming using the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) involves establishing connections with multiple internet service providers (ISPs) to achieve network redundancy and load balancing. Here's a brief explanation of how multihoming can be implemented using BGP:

1. Acquiring multiple ISP connections: Obtain connectivity from multiple ISPs by establishing physical links or virtual private connections (e.g., MPLS, IPsec tunnels) to each ISP. This establishes multiple paths to the internet.

2. Obtaining an Autonomous System (AS) number: Obtain an AS number, which uniquely identifies your network, from a Regional Internet Registry (RIR). This number is used to exchange routing information with other networks.

3. Running BGP: Configure BGP on your network edge routers to establish peering sessions with the routers of each ISP. BGP is responsible for exchanging routing information and determining the best paths for traffic.

4. Advertise network prefixes: Advertise your network's IP prefixes (blocks of IP addresses assigned to you) to your ISPs using BGP. This informs the ISPs about the reachable IP ranges in your network.

5. Route selection and preference: Configure BGP to set different attributes, such as local preference and MED (Multi-Exit Discriminator), to influence the selection of routes. This allows you to prioritize certain paths or prefer certain ISPs for outbound and inbound traffic.

6. Load balancing: Utilize BGP's ability to advertise multiple paths for the same destination. By announcing the same IP prefixes with different path attributes, BGP can distribute traffic across the available ISP connections, achieving load balancing.

7. Monitoring and failover: Implement monitoring mechanisms to detect link or ISP failures. When a failure occurs, BGP can automatically withdraw the affected routes and select alternate paths, rerouting traffic through the remaining operational connections.

8. Security and filtering: Implement appropriate security measures, such as access control lists (ACLs) and route filtering, to ensure the exchange of routing information is secure and to prevent the propagation of incorrect or malicious routes.

By implementing these steps, BGP enables a network to leverage multiple ISP connections for improved resilience, increased performance, and efficient utilization of available bandwidth through multihoming.

### GPT 4
Multihoming using the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) involves establishing a secondary BGP session via another service provider (SP) ¹. This can ensure that BGP routes and services are up and running all the time. When you connect your network to two different Internet service providers (ISPs), it is called multihoming. Multihoming provides redundancy and network optimization by selecting the ISP which offers the best path to a resource ².

Here are some steps to implement multihoming using BGP:
1. Connect your network to two different ISPs.
2. Establish a BGP session with each ISP.
3. Advertise your network's routes to both ISPs.
4. Configure BGP policies to control incoming and outgoing traffic.

5. [Problem-solving/Mathematics] If you are given a k-port switch, how many hosts can you support using a
2-layer leaf-spine topology with full bisection bandwidth? Show your work.

### Reference Answer
Ans: k**2/2 k switches at the leaf layer, k/2 at the spine layer. All leaf
layer switches host k/2 servers each. The remaining ports on the leaf layer
switches are connected to all of the spine layer switches.

### GPT 3
In a 2-layer leaf-spine topology with full bisection bandwidth, the number of hosts that can be supported using a k-port switch can be calculated as follows:

- The leaf layer connects directly to the hosts, while the spine layer provides connectivity between the leaves.
- In a full bisection bandwidth scenario, each leaf switch is connected to every spine switch, and each spine switch is connected to every leaf switch.
- To calculate the maximum number of hosts supported, we need to consider the number of leaf switches and the number of ports available on each leaf switch.

Assuming the k-port switch refers to the number of ports on each leaf switch, here's the calculation:

- Each leaf switch has k ports.
- Each spine switch is connected to every leaf switch, so the number of spine switches required is the ceiling of (number of leaf switches / k). Let's denote this as n.
- Each spine switch connects to every leaf switch, resulting in n * k connections.
- Each leaf switch connects to every spine switch, resulting in n * k connections.
- The total number of host connections supported is given by (n * k) * k.

Therefore, the maximum number of hosts supported can be calculated as:
Number of hosts = (n * k) * k

For example, let's assume we have a 48-port switch (k = 48) in a 2-layer leaf-spine topology:

- Number of leaf switches = number of ports on each leaf switch = k = 48
- Number of spine switches = ceil(48 / 48) = 1
- Number of host connections supported = (1 * 48) * 48 = 2304

So, in this case, a 48-port switch in a 2-layer leaf-spine topology with full bisection bandwidth can support a maximum of 2304 hosts.

### GPT 4
In a 2-layer leaf-spine topology with full bisection bandwidth, the number of hosts that can be supported using a k-port switch can be calculated as follows:

1. Each leaf switch has k ports and is connected to k spine switches.
2. Each spine switch has k ports and is connected to k leaf switches.
3. Each leaf switch has (k/2) ports available for connecting to hosts.
4. There are k leaf switches in total.

Therefore, the total number of hosts that can be supported in this topology is (k/2) * k = k^2/2.

6. [Evaluation/Analysis] Consider a variant of the congestion avoidance and control protocol, where
instead of an additive increase and multiplicative decrease, we perform a
multiplicative increase and additive decrease. Would such a congestion-control
algorithm perform well? Why or why not?

### Reference Answer
Ans: No. The multiplicative increase is too aggressive to be combated by an
additive decrease. This would rapidly lead to a situation with very large
windows for each sender and a congestion collapse situation triggered by
spurious retransmissions.

### GPT 3
A congestion-control algorithm that employs a multiplicative increase and additive decrease approach is unlikely to perform well. The multiplicative increase can lead to aggressive behavior and rapid congestion, while the fixed additive decrease may not effectively mitigate congestion. This approach can result in unfairness among flows, instability, and oscillations in the network. In contrast, the widely adopted additive increase and multiplicative decrease approach offers better stability, fairness, and responsiveness in network congestion control.

### GPT 4
A congestion-control algorithm that performs a multiplicative increase and additive decrease would likely not perform well. This is because a multiplicative increase can cause the congestion window to grow too quickly, leading to network congestion. On the other hand, an additive decrease may not be sufficient to reduce the congestion window enough to alleviate congestion.

The standard additive increase and multiplicative decrease algorithm used in TCP congestion control is designed to balance the growth and reduction of the congestion window in response to network conditions. The additive increase allows for gradual growth of the congestion window, while the multiplicative decrease allows for a rapid reduction in response to congestion. This balance helps to prevent network congestion while still allowing for efficient use of available bandwidth.

7. [Problem-solving/Network Management] Let's say you are a website operator and you suddenly find yourself under a
distributed denial-of-service attack from many clients trying to access the
website at the same time. How could you use BGP to prevent your webserver from
being overwhelmed by more traffic than it can handle?

### Reference Answer
Ans: You can use BGP to advertise a different AS level path for your IP
address. This AS level path would redirect incoming traffic to your IP address
to a "protector" service (who you pay), who could scrub the traffic and send
you only legitimate looking traffic.

### GPT 3
To prevent a webserver from being overwhelmed by more traffic than it can handle during a distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack, BGP can be utilized to implement traffic engineering techniques. Here's a high-level approach:

By manipulating BGP routing announcements, you can redirect the traffic destined for your website to a traffic scrubbing service or a DDoS mitigation provider. This can be achieved by advertising more specific routes with higher local preference or shorter AS path to the provider's IP addresses responsible for traffic filtering. These announcements will influence other routers to prefer the path towards the mitigation provider, effectively diverting the attack traffic before it reaches your webserver. The traffic scrubbing service can then analyze the incoming traffic, filter out the malicious requests, and forward the legitimate traffic to your webserver, ensuring that it only receives the manageable and safe traffic load.

### GPT 4
One way to use BGP to prevent a webserver from being overwhelmed by a distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack is to reroute traffic to a security provider that can filter out malicious traffic before it reaches your webserver. This can be done by establishing a BGP session with a security provider and using BGP to redirect incoming traffic to the security provider's network. The security provider can then analyze the traffic in real-time and filter out malicious DDoS attack traffic using techniques such as deep packet inspection. Once the malicious traffic has been filtered out, the security provider can send the remaining clean traffic back to your webserver via a secure tunnel ¹.

Another technique that can be used is BGP Blackholing, which involves dropping traffic destined for a specific IP address at the network edge using BGP. This can be an effective way to quickly mitigate a DDoS attack targeting a specific IP address ³.

8. [Problem-solving/Computer Architecture] Assume that an ALU within the RMT architecture is capable of implementing
the 2 operations pkt.f1 + pkt.f2 and pkt.f1 - pkt.f2. Here, pkt represents a
packet and f1 and f2 are packet headers. How many pipeline stages would you
need to implement the operation pkt.f1 + pkt.f2 + pkt.f3 - pkt.f4. What
operations would run in each pipeline stage?

### Reference Answer
Ans: First stage does f1+f2 and f3-f4 in parallel. The results are written into
header tmp1 and tmp2. Then the second stage adds tmp1 and tmp2.

### GPT 3
To implement the operation pkt.f1 + pkt.f2 + pkt.f3 - pkt.f4 with an ALU within the RMT architecture, you would need a total of four pipeline stages. Here's a breakdown of the operations in each stage:

1. Stage 1: pkt.f1 + pkt.f2 (Addition operation)
   - In this stage, the ALU performs the addition operation between the values of pkt.f1 and pkt.f2.

2. Stage 2: Intermediate Result + pkt.f3 (Addition operation)
   - The intermediate result obtained from Stage 1 is added to the value of pkt.f3 using the ALU.

3. Stage 3: Intermediate Result - pkt.f4 (Subtraction operation)
   - The intermediate result from Stage 2 is subtracted by the value of pkt.f4 using the ALU.

4. Stage 4: Final Result
   - The result obtained from Stage 3 represents the final result of the operation pkt.f1 + pkt.f2 + pkt.f3 - pkt.f4.

By dividing the operation into these four pipeline stages, each stage can sequentially execute the necessary ALU operations, allowing for efficient processing of the packet headers and calculation of the final result.

### GPT 4
To implement the operation `pkt.f1 + pkt.f2 + pkt.f3 - pkt.f4` using an ALU within the RMT architecture that is capable of implementing the operations `pkt.f1 + pkt.f2` and `pkt.f1 - pkt.f2`, you would need 3 pipeline stages. Here's how the operations would be performed in each stage:

1. In the first pipeline stage, the ALU would perform the operation `pkt.f1 + pkt.f2`, resulting in a temporary value `temp1 = pkt.f1 + pkt.f2`.
2. In the second pipeline stage, the ALU would perform the operation `temp1 + pkt.f3`, resulting in a temporary value `temp2 = temp1 + pkt.f3`.
3. In the third pipeline stage, the ALU would perform the operation `temp2 - pkt.f4`, resulting in the final value of `temp2 - pkt.f4`.
